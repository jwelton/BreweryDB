             "description": "Bastone first opened its doors in May of 2004. It is named and styled after the famous Belgian city (though the spelling has been simplified). This unique restaurant and brewery is housed in a 1930’s era building, the exterior of which has been restored to it’s original art deco look in association with the State of Michigan Historical Society. Inside, the high arched ceiling, wood floors and white subway wall tiles create the comfortable yet sophisticated atmosphere of a European brasserie.",

             "description": "Fox Barrel Cider Company was founded by Sean Deorsey and Bruce Nissen in 2004. Both tired of the corporate life, in the accounting & sales arenas, Sean and Bruce decided to start their own business. Sean has been crafting ciders since his days at Santa Clara Universityand believes that \"it's much better to crunch apples than to crunch numbers.\" Along with his wife and two young daughters, Sean resides in Auburn, California.\r\n\r\nBruce has worked in sales, marketing and business management roles over the past several years. He had been interested in developing an organization and had become smitten with cider since introduced to it several years ago. Along with his wife and their young son & daughter, Bruce resides in Colfax, California.\r\n\r\nAfter looking throughout the Sierra Foothills, the pair chose a location in the historic railroad town of Colfax, California. The cidery originally sat in the historic Fruit Growers Exchange Association, a building that once was a storage and packing facility for the abundance of fruits grown in the area. It seemed appropriate to use this space, bringing it back towards its original use. After two years in that location, the cidery outgrew the space and moved to a much larger facility less than a mile down the road.",

It had a very mom and pop feel, and featured a look that was as traditional as it gets. Those who knew of it visited regularly, but the regulars were few. For many, the brewery was a thing shrouded in mystery... college students-which comprise a fair percentage of Ellensburg's population for most of the year-would occasionally see a bottle on a store shelf and ask where it came from. The likely response:\r\n\r\n\"Yeah, I think some dude makes that in his basement or something...\"\r\n\r\nThe word just wasn't getting out, and things didn't look good for the tiny brewery that made exceptionally tasty ales. \r\nWell, a couple of hoodlums in their late-twenties jumped on the opportunity to own and operate their own brewery, and what resulted is the Iron Horse Brewery you know and love today. They tweaked some recipes, changed some names, threw some ridiculous theme parties to encourage locals to actually see the brewery with their own eyes, and good things started to happen. Locals started to dig what the guys were doing. A few bars took a chance and put Iron Horse back on tap, and the beer started flowing. \r\n\r\nThe word started getting out.",

Because the river is located in our backyard, current Brewmaster/President, Howard McMurry chose Madison River for the name of our world-class brewery.  Sticking with the theme, most MRBC beers carry the name of a fishing fly.\r\n\r\nMadison River Brewing Company, Inc. started in 2004 when Howard purchased the brewery and equipment from Moab Brewing.  At that time, we contract-brewed for Moab, Park City, and Big Hole breweries. In 2005, Madison River Brewing Company emerged when we received a state license to brew our own brands.",

Fortunately for beer lovers in North Texas, Fritz not only fell in love with Fort Worth, but also fell in love with his future wife here. And in another fortuitous twist for all of us, Fritz’s wife, Erin, gave him the thumbs up when he announced that he would like to carry on the Rahr family tradition of brewing.\r\n\r\nFritz and Erin founded Rahr & Sons Brewing Co. in the fall of 2004. In five years, the brewery has more than doubled its brewing capacity - from 2,000 barrels per year to over 5,000 barrels per year and has won fifteen nationally-recognized awards, including a Bronze Medal at the 2008 World Beer Cup for Bucking Bock and 2009 National Grand Champion from the United States Beer Tasting Championships for Iron Thistle.",

Owner/Brewers Nick Anderson and Dan Chang started the company in 2004 with the help of a third partner, Robbie Stair after relocating to Minneapolis from Seattle. Robbie owned a farm in scenic Maiden Rock, WI just above the confluence of the Rush River and Lake Pepin. After converting a pole barn into a fully functioning brewery, the trio produced a limited quantity of draft-only beers while steadily building a reputation  for brewing high quality ales. After two and a half years of growth, it became evident that bottled beer was the next move to be made. Luckily, the town of River Falls, WI came to the table with an offer to build a custom building for a brand new brewery. In 2007, the new facility opened its doors with the addition of a refurbished bottling line, and additional fermenters. The new Rush River brewery was now poised to increase production and distributorship. We now have ten distributors in two states and produce nine brands including seasonals. Our small size still allows us to experiment with new styles, while the larger capacity for brewing and storage keep our regular brands flowing out the door.",

While this helps them taste fresher and more full-flavored, it also means that extended exposure to warm temperatures may cause them (especially if they are unfiltered) to taste, well, less fresh. So keep 'em cool! As for the dark part, let's just say that sunlight can negatively affect some brews (it makes 'em smell \"skunky\"). That's why we put our beers in light-blocking brown bottles and take extra caution to keep them out of the way of direct sunlight.",
