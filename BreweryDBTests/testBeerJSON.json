Served in the traditional 23 oz. glass, the beer pours with a voluminous white mirangue-like head atop a hazy orange body. You know the aromas...it's a Hefeweizen, and our yeast is particularly rich in clove. The body is proteinaceous from the use of over 50% wheat. The finish, a thing of beauty; creamy, refreshing, a lasting fruit menagerie.",

"description": "Airdale Horizon, is a style of wheat beer (weissbier).  It is made with a typical ratio of 40:60, or even higher, wheat to barley malt.  This beer is light, bright, and zippy on the palate with an often dry and tart edge, coupled with some hop spiciness.  Little hop bitterness permeates the beer and it possesses a moderate level of alcohol.  The “Hefe” prefix means “with yeast”, hence the beers unfiltered and cloudy appearance.  Often served with a lemon wedge (popularized by Americans), to either cut the wheat or yeast edge, which many find to be a f lavorful snap.",

"description": "Bayliner Weisse is our take on the traditional German Berliner Weisse style.\r\n\r\nHere at GSB, we are all fans of sour beers so naturally we've been eager to brew one of our own. Bayliner Weisse is our take on the traditional German Berliner Weisse style. Over 700 breweries in Germany used to make this beer and by the 19th century it was their most popular style of beer. By the late 20th century only two breweries in Berlin still produce these beers. This particular style is an unfiltered, sour wheat beer that comes in at about 3.6% alc/vol. It is a nice sessionable beer that can be enjoyed anytime of the year. Traditionally served with woodruff or raspberry syrup but it is most enjoyable when served on it's own.",

Because yeast is present, the beer will have yeast flavor and a characteristically fuller mouthfeel and may be appropriately very cloudy. No diacetyl should be perceived.",
